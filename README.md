Problem 1: SumOfDistinctElements Algorithm
Description
This algorithm computes the sum of distinct elements from two sets. It uses two arrays, set1 and set2, and iterates through each element in set1. For each element, it checks whether it is present in set2. If not, the element is added to the sum. The algorithm then performs a similar process for elements in set2. Finally, it prints the sum of distinct elements.

Usage
Define the sets set1 and set2.
Call the SumOfDistinctElements algorithm.
Example
pseudocode
Copy code
set1 = [3, 1, 7, 9]
set2 = [2, 4, 1, 9, 3]
SumOfDistinctElements()
Output: The sum of distinct elements is displayed.

Problem 2: Dot Product Procedure and Function
Procedure: procedure_name
This procedure computes the dot product of two arrays, arr1 and arr2, and stores the result in the total variable.

Function: dot_product
This function computes the dot product of two arrays, arr1 and arr2, and returns the result. If the arrays have different lengths, it returns an error message.

Usage
Call procedure_name or dot_product by providing the required arrays.
Example
pseudocode
Copy code
arr1 = [1, 2, 3]
arr2 = [4, 5, 6]
total = 0
procedure_name(arr1, arr2, total)
result = dot_product(arr1, arr2)
Algorithm: orthogonal
Description
This algorithm checks if three vectors, v1, v2, and v3, are orthogonal based on their dot products. It uses the dot_product function to calculate dot products and checks if the result is zero, indicating orthogonality.

Usage
Define the vectors v1, v2, and v3.
Call the orthogonal algorithm.
Example
pseudocode
Copy code
v1 = [1, 0, 0, 1]
v2 = [0, 1, 0, 0]
v3 = [0, 0, 0, 1]
orthogonal()
Output: The orthogonality status of the vectors is displayed.
